CUSTOMISING DIOGENES
--------------------

Diogenes provides several means of customising its look and behaviour.

 * CONFIGURATION FILE

The first thing you can modify is Diogenes's configuration file called 
"diogenes.config.inc.php". To have a list of the values you can assign, take a
look at the file called "diogenes.globals.inc.php".

 * SUBCLASSING DIOGENES'S CLASSES

Diogenes is written in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it is possible to
specify the classes to use from the configuration file. For instance, if you
want to change the look and/or behaviour of Diogenes's toplevel pages you would :

- create a class called "CustomToplevel" for instance, which derives from 
  "DiogenesToplevel".  Let us say this class is stored in a file called
  "custom.toplevel.inc.php".

- include "custom.toplevel.inc.php" from your configuration file like this :

  require_once 'custom.toplevel.inc.php';

- tell Diogenes to use your CustomToplevel class to display toplevel pages by
  setting the following in your configuration file :

  $globals->toplevel = "CustomToplevel";
